In order to set the backside of the flipping page dark I setup the UIPageViewController to be `doubleSided`.  Then insert a blank page for all the even pages.  The background of these blank pages adjusts to be either dark or light depending on the current configuration.

This code is rough and should only be used as an example not used directly in any project.
